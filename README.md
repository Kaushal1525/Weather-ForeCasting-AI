🌤️ Weather Temperature Prediction using Decision Trees
📌 About
This project implements a Decision Tree Regression Model to predict daily temperatures based on weather conditions. The dataset includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, and the model predicts temperature based on these factors.

🚀 Features
✅ Uses Decision Tree Regression for prediction
✅ Converts weather conditions into numeric labels
✅ Generates synthetic weather data (Humidity, Wind Speed, Weather Condition)
✅ Predicts temperature for custom weather inputs
✅ Evaluates model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on the Daily Minimum Temperatures Dataset sourced from jbrownlee/Datasets.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
DecisionTreeRegressor (Model Training)# Weather-ForeCasting-AI
